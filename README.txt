A CONSOLE GAME BY A ----- [DOESN'T MATTER].

NO EXTRA INFO IS REQUIRED JUST OPEN UP THE
"2048 GAME [RELEASE]" FOLDER AND FIND 2048
(.exe) FILE OPEN IT AND HAVE FUN.

[COMMAND PROMPT] CONSOLE ONLY! [ALTHOUGH THERE
COULD BE VISUAL PROBLEMS IN WIN 10 CONSOLE TOO]

NOTE: THE CODE IS NOT TO BE LOOKED AT, IT'S
A COMPLETE MESS OVER THERE. YOU CAN STILL
LOOK AT IT, BUT REMEBER I WARNED YOU...

THE AUTOMATIC GAME OVER FEATURE WAS NOT ADDED
BECAUSE IT HAD SOME PROBLEMS. IT STILL EXISTS
IN THE CODE AND THE CASES ARE INCLUDED AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE CODE, AND I MAY/MAY NOT FIX THAT
IN FUTURE.

ALSO, THE LOADING BAR THING IS JUST FOR SHOW.
IT TAKES LESS THAN A SECOND IN ACTUAL TIME BUT
I WANTED SOME ANIMATION FOR LOADING SCREEN.

THAT'S ALL! TY FOR READING...
HAVE FUN WITH THE GAME!
